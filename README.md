In **flight_search.py**, you will need to create a new **ACCESS_TOKEN** to make the code work. 
Remove comments from line 24, 25, 75, 78 and place them back once you printed the new token, and updated **ACCESS_TOKEN**

In the same file, please insert your own **API_KEY** and **API_SECRET** from _Amadeus API_.

In the **notification manager file**: please enter your own **self.account_sid**, **self.auth_token** from _Twilio API_.
Please follow Twilio's APi instructions to send the alert to your Whatsapp number.

Then run the main.py.
